## Hands Up!
This plugin is already out of date. It still works, but if you are using JetFormBuilder `>=1.4.0` version, then you should abandon this plugin and use the native functionality.

However, in case of migration, you will have to redo the macro format\
from `%FIELD::text_field%`\
to `<!--JFB_FIELD::text_field-->`
